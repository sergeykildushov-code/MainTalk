The Discord logo

The Discord logo consists of two elements; the icon (Clyde)
and the wordmark. Itâ€™s an instantly recognisable brand
element and should be represented consistently throughout
our product and marketing efforts. The logo should always
try to exist with the symbol and wordmark together. In no
way should the logo be modified, distorted, or redrawn

# Bots and Webhooks

Base endpoint is: `/ocs/v2.php/apps/spreed/api/v1`: (requires the `bots-v1` capability - available since Nextcloud 27.1)

Webhook based bots are available with the Nextcloud 27.1 compatible Nextcloud Talk 17.1 release as a first version

!!! note

    For security reasons bots can only be added via the
    command line. `./occ  talk:bot:install --help` gives you
    a short overview of the required arguments, but they are
    also explained in the [OCC documentation](occ.md#talkbotinstall).

---

## Signing and Verifying Requests

Messages are signed using the shared secret that is specified when installing a bot on the server.
Create a HMAC with SHA256 over the `RANDOM` header and the request body using the shared secret.
Only when the `SIGNATURE` matches the request should be accepted and handled.

**Sample PHP code:**

```php
$digest = hash_hmac('sha256', $_SERVER['HTTP_X_NEXTCLOUD_TALK_RANDOM'] . file_get_contents('php://input'), $secret);

if (!hash_equals($digest, strtolower($_SERVER['HTTP_X_NEXTCLOUD_TALK_SIGNATURE']))) {
    exit;
}
```

## Receiving chat messages

Bot receives all the chat messages following the same signature/verification method.

## Nextcloud apps as a bot

ðŸ†• Added in Talk 21.

Instead of being webhook based, bots can also listen to the [`OCA\Talk\Events\BotInvokeEvent` PHP events](events.md#bot-invoke) and get invoked with the same content.
The event allows to `addAnswer()` and `addReaction()` which will then be posted and reacted as the bot.
The advantage is that a web request can be saved, reducing the load on the system.

When installing the bot specify `nextcloudapp://$APPID` as the bot URL, together with the `4` as a [Bot feature flag](constants.md#bot-features).

## Changelog

### Nextcloud 27.1 / Talk 17.1 - September 2023
- Initial version

### Nextcloud 31 / Talk 21 - February 2025
- Added direct support for Nextcloud apps as bots. A new feature flag `events` which indicates that a bot will utilize the `OCA\Talk\Events\BotInvokeEvent` event listed in [PHP events](events.md#bot-invoke) rather than being invoked via a webhook.
- Added new feature flag `reaction` which allows to get invoked for added and removed reactions
- In hooks that are replies the new optional field `object.inReplyTo` contains the actor and content of the parent chat message
